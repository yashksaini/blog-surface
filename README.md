## About the Project
Blog Surface is a blogging platform designed to empower users to share their thoughts, experiences, and expertise with the world. It offers a plethora of features that cater to both bloggers and readers. The platform is divided into three main pages: the user profile page, the blog creation page, and the home page. Users can create accounts with their email and password, and upon logging in, they can update their profiles with images, hobbies, and personal information. The rich text editor on the blog creation page allows bloggers to create captivating content with ease, including the addition of images and formatting. All blogs created by a user are conveniently listed on their profile page, and on the home page, users can explore and engage with a wide range of public blogs contributed by the community.
